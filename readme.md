# TensorMath
### A header-only linear algebra library
*WIP*

Designed to be a lightweight alternative to libraries like Eigen.

Perfect for small computer graphics, physics, or machine learning projects.

Planned Components:
- matrices
- vectors
- fixed size vectors(serializable)
- Cameras
- bounding boxes
- Tensors(n dimensional matrices)

Planned Features:
- Header only
- All the utilities you will ever need
- Completely integrated types, lots of operators
- Documented and tested
- Clean commented code, easy to modify
- Some extra goodies for GPU acceleration

Potential Features:
- Sparse matrices
- Voxel grids
- Some optimizations
- Other types(not just doubles)
